## General info
A challenge to build the business logic to model a simple thermostat, and learn to hook it up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery. Additionally, to use JavaScript to fetch data sources and display those on the page. Jamine is used to help test-drive the project.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* JavaScript 
* jQuery 
* HTML
* CSS

## Specifications

* Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
* You can increase the temperature with an up function
* You can decrease the temperature with a down function
* The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
* If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* Power saving mode is on by default but it can also be turned off
* You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
* You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
* Low-usage will be indicated with blue, medium-usage indicated with white, high-usage indicated with dark orange.
